## Objectives

- Compare multiple machine learning models on a single dataset
- Evaluate models using metrics: accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
- Identify and document the best performing model

***

## Dataset

**Source:** Included as `archive (2).zip` (extract in project directory)

***

## Workflow

- **Data Loading**
  - Import, clean, and prepare data
- **Model Comparison**
  - Set up baseline models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
  - Cross-validate and compare via multiple metrics
- **Evaluation & Visualization**
  - Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall curves
  - Confusion matrices and evaluation plots
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**
  - Automated search (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
  - Analyze improvements, select best parameters
- **Best Model Selection**
  - Present and justify the top model for the dataset/task

***

## Installation & Usage

**Requirements**

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

**Steps**

1. Clone/download this repository.
2. Extract `archive (2).zip` to access the dataset.
3. Run `Project_Notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter for model building and evaluation.
